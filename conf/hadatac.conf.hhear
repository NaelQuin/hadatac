       description="Established in 2019, the goal of the HHEAR program is to promote the characterization of the totality of human environmental exposures called the exposome. The exposome includes chemical, physical, and biological stressors as well as lifestyle and social environments. Researchers will harmonize data to gain a better understanding of complicated interactions between environmental factors as determinants of health. HHEAR is a consortium that enables NIH-funded researchers to measure environmental exposures and integrate their data with other datasets by providing access to laboratory, statistical, and data science analysis services."
